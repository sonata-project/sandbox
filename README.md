Quick Installation
------------------

The Sonata Project provides a build of the current sandbox to quickly start with the projet.

    curl -L github https://github.com/sonata-project/sandbox-build/archive/2.4.tar.gz | tar xzv

Once, you have the file, you can either use

### Local Installation 

* Configure default the ``parameters.yml`` file: ``cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml``
* load the data: ``php bin/load_data.php``
* You should should be ready to go ...

### Vagrant Installation

* vagrant up --provision --provider=virtualbox (Vagrant is going to get the environnement, install it for you and load sonata sample data)
* Configure your host ``sudo nano /etc/hosts`` and add this line ``192.168.33.99   sonata.local``
* Open your browser [here][link_sonata]


Composer Installation
---------------------

Get composer:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Run the following command for the 2.4 develop branch:

    php composer.phar create-project sonata-project/sandbox:dev-2.4-develop 

The installation process used Incenteev's ParameterHandler to handle parameters.yml configuration. With the current
installation, it is possible to use environment variables to configure this file:

    DATABASE_NAME=sonata DATABASE_USER=root DATABASE_PASSWORD="" php composer.phar create-project sonata-project/sandbox:dev-2.4-develop

You might experience some timeout issues with composer, as the ``create-project`` start different scripts, you can increase the default composer value with the ``COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT`` env variable:

    COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT=600 php composer.phar create-project sonata-project/sandbox:dev-2.4-develop

Fixtures are automatically loaded on the ``composer create-project`` step. If you'd like to reset your sandbox to the default fixtures (or you had an issue while installing and want to fill in the fixtures manually), you may run:

    php bin/load_data.php

This will completely reset your database.

Run
---

If you are running PHP5.4, you can use the built in server to start the demo:

    app/console server:run localhost:9090

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:9090/
